		p.c-chapter-text The abstract nature of architecture, music and lighting in Xenakis’s ‘gestures’ stemmed from his desire to deal with ‘laws and pure ideas’ rather than concrete objects. Abstraction was the medium for the message of an artist convinced in the possibility of art expressing nature’s essential truths. What could be more essential than an art based on maths and logic?
		p.c-chapter-text Xenakis’s non-anthropomorphic forms attempted to explain humankind as a speck of dust floating through the universe. Still, he remained committed to moving the most human parts of any audience.
		p.c-chapter-text It’s not completely convincing, though. If Xenakis wanted such a close imitation of nature, why not cut out art altogether? For all the calculations, his music did not always produce the intended effect. An audience without prior knowledge – perhaps even with prior knowledge – is not likely to see <i>Pithoprakta</i> as a study in the statistical distribution of mass form. The critic Benoît Gibson suggests that, rather than sounding like glissandi travelling at ‘1148 speeds’, <i>Pithoprakta</i> is more like an indiscriminate cloud of plucked strings. This is where the gulf between mimesis and the real thing looks increasingly confused. The glissandi of <i>Pithoprakta</i> are not the passages of a gas molecule in fixed space, but the perceptual counterpart of speed – the sound of a bow scraping a string. So - why art? Why not walk the audience down the street to show the statistical distribution of sound?
		p.c-chapter-text For me, it’s no wonder that John Cage, George Maciunas and others associated with Fluxus were gearing up to have their say around this time. Art had conceded that the best it could do was express reality as perception - so why not remove its ‘artfulness’ and take to the street? Better a thing in itself than its refracted image.
		p.c-chapter-text Another issue is the intelligibility of synthesis in Xenakis’s Polytopes. It’s worth questioning whether Xenakis’s choice of media really does offer a system closer to ‘the logic of thought’. For all of Xenakis’s talk of ‘outlines’, sensory overload may well undermine his merging of forms. No amount of mathematical justification can avoid the obstruction of the piece’s intelligibility through its avoidance of recognisable linguistic and visual reference points. And if it is unintelligible, Xenakis’s criticism of serialism could surely apply to his own work too: tripping itself up and losing shape in the over-complicated criss-crossing of patterns.

		p.c-chapter-text Xenakis’s relation of music to architecture made him consider music first as a shape, and then as a fluid mass form. It distinguished his work from contemporaries whose serialist compositions relied too heavily on pitch to travel anywhere near as exciting as <i>Metastaseis</i>. Xenakis may not have been the first, but he showed that music needn’t be as linear as it appears on the page; music, just like the universe, could have multiple dimensions.
		p.c-chapter-text And of course abstract forms based on quantum mechanics and theories of statistical distribution will invite accusations of elitism. But Xenakis maintained that an audience could appreciate his art for its sensation just as much as its system. Both experiences could equally realize a belief held by Xenakis – and traced back to the ancients by way of the Romantic poets and others – that art could reveal a truth beyond the artwork itself. Unintelligibility could be valid.

		p.c-chapter-text Finally – why art? For me, it's because Xenakis used abstraction as a microscope: artworks were controlled examinations of natural forces. And if an artist attempts to further our understanding of the universe through mimesis, it follows that the artist should unite forms that have a superficial distinction in nature. Xenakis’s attempt at uniting architecture, music and light through geometry allows us a better knowledge of ‘things’ (the rallying call of the Fluxus group too).
		p.c-chapter-text When I saw <i>Metastaseis</i> performed at the Teatro dell’Opera in Rome, I didn’t know what to think. Inside the stuccoed walls of the opera-house, it had the power of the intruder, someone’s snooty Continental cousin with all the provocative opinions.My friend Fergal had joined me that night. We went for a beer afterwards and tried to say a few words about the music. It didn’t take too long before we moved onto another topic. What was there to say?
		p.c-chapter-text Yet here I am writing. The drum of rain-drops, a memory of war-time Athens: a scrambling for meaning in the flickering moment. My experience of Xenakis’s sound was just as he had intended, I think.
