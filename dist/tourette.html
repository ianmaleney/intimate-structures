    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>A memory</i>: In 1944 Iannis Xenakis is a member of the Greek resistance. He takes part in a street demonstration in Athens to protest against the Axis powers now occupying Greece. The chants of protesters ring out as their slogan echoes like a gigantic rhythm through the avenues. The rhythm bursts suddenly into sharp, shattering chaos as they are fired on; bullets whistle by, machine guns crackle in the distance. The crowd flee, and then - </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">There is a silence. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">This is the memory Xenakis returns to time and again. To reproduce it in its fullness, he decides, sound must be understood by way of its distribution in space. A shout, a crash, a gunshot – all operate individually within the composite.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">By the time Xenakis arrived in Paris on the 11th November 1947 he was mostly two things: a refugee and an engineer. He had fled Greece, his home country, and would not return until the mid-seventies, having been sentenced to death in absentia by the right-wing regime for his involvement in the Communist resistance. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It’s easy to forget that Xenakis is as human after all. I think of the challenges any new arrival to a city must endure, not least someone like Xenakis who had suffered the trauma of war. Surely he endured the loneliness of long yawning hours in cafes, the walks home through deserted boulevards, the sense of confusion when the butcher asks whether he’d like his steak haché ‘<i>bouef ou cheval</i>’?</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis was young, and many of his friends had died in the war. He was disfigured too: a shelling attack had blinded him in his left eye during his time as a member of the national liberation front. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">I feel for him, but I also can’t help wondering at the shapes and music that must have entered his mind as he walked through the unfamiliar streets and gloomy streets of Paris in November.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">At this stage, he was neither architect nor composer. He had a degree in civil engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, and despite studying harmony and counterpoint for a time in Greece, music was a hobby.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">At the same time, Le Corbusier was garnering a reputation as one of the most forward-thinking architects of the day, with writings on urbanism and design (such as <i>Vers une Architecture</i> from 1923) gaining him international standing. France was looking to Le Corbusier to realise a post-war dream of housing for all; Xenakis knew little of modern architecture and less of this national architect. Funny then, how Le Corbusier would answer the Greek civil engineer’s correspondence to hire him at his ‘<i>Atelier des Bâtisseurs</i>’. For Xenakis, this mostly meant that he could make rent. He could not have known the hand he would have in Le Corbusier’s fashioning of a new French public architecture: at the Unité d’Habitation in Marseille, for example, Le Corbusier (with the help of Xenakis) would give the worker high ceilings, green spaces, and two floors of living space.</p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">At Le Corbusier’s studio Xenakis began his first serious engagement with architecture. The architect had studied painting, and had no formal training in his profession; the fact that Xenakis was a novice learning under an untrained idealist perhaps explains the originality of his work. As time went on, Le Corbusier granted Xenakis increasing responsibility: he designed aspects of Rezé-les-Nantes (another unité d’habitation), the urbanization project at Firminy, and the ‘plug’ form of the Assembly building at Chandigarh in India.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">In the meantime, Xenakis continued his studies in composition. After a few false starts (‘This is no music!’ declared Arthur Honegger when he first examined some early scores), Xenakis found a mentor and teacher in Olivier Messiaen, auditing his classes at the Conservatoire in Paris between 1951 and 1953.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Le Corbusier’s lack of surprise at Xenakis’s flair for architecture and music can only be explained by his belief that the two forms were complementary. His description of architecture as an ‘event’ implying relationships and the ‘appreciation of proportions’ could be applied, he believed, to music too. And while Le Corbusier regarded music with an architect’s eye, it worked the other way round for Xenakis.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container"> 
    <p class="c-chapter-text">(I think of the three columns of photos on my bedroom wall, straight but for the two crooked pictures not quite aligned at the bottom right-hand corner. My jaw tightens: it’s as dissonant as any music I’ve heard.)</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container"> 
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis initially learned from Le Corbusier that music could be put into dialogue with architecture through proportional systems. Le Corbusier’s <i>Modulor</i> called for a system of proportions with the human body as its reference-point; if, as Le Corbusier wrote, architecture was the art of constructing ‘volumes and surfaces enclosing and controlling human activities’, so the human should replace the metre to regulate space. Proportions were calculated in two series (as illustrated in Le Corbusier’s famous <a href="http://www.lifeofanarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Le-Corbusier-Modular-Man.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modulor Man</a>), one beginning at the six-foot figure’s navel and the other based on the figure’s entire height with arms stretched upwards. Intervals increased according to the Golden Ratio – the ancient system of proportions drawn from nature.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">These human proportions were more than theoretical: they were a daily tool for Le Corbusier’s architects who designed the ceilings in the apartments at Rezé-les-Nantes, for instance, to be 2.26 metres high – the height of the six-foot figure with arms extended.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The Golden Ratio was the formula Xenakis used to link the Modulor’s visual harmonics to musical harmony. He looked to the Fibonacci sequence (the series determining the harmonic intervals in an octave) and noted the equivalence between the proportions of musical intervals in harmony and physical dimensions. This tendency to essentialise would set the standard for future approaches to multimedia compositions: forms were to be reduced to mathematical expressions, and so united under a shared logic.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Yet it wasn’t until <i>Metastaseis</i> (written 1953 – 54) that Xenakis began to compose a music of space. The initial plan for <i>Metastaseis</i> was graphically notated – appearing more like an architectural blue-print than a musical score. Xenakis had taken the advice of Messiaen, who told him: ‘…you are almost thirty, you have the good fortune of being Greek, of being an architect and having studied special mathematics. Take advantage of these things. Do them in your music.’ </p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container"> 
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Having listened to it many times over, I'm unable to conceive of <i>Metastaseis</i> as anything but a structure. To understand the piece, one must think of its score as a sketch of its shape. For Xenakis, musical notation ran along two axes: the vertical axis plotted pitch, and the horizontal axis plotted time. It was a geometry of sound, Xenakis explained: ‘Musicians invented analytical geometry before Descartes, with musical notation, which is no more than space shared by two dimensions having nothing in common: pitch and time.’</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">This doesn’t mean that <i>Metastaseis</i> was intended as a mere musical representation of shape. This geometrical analogy was central to Xenakis’s thinking from the very beginning – he reconsidered traditional methods of composing, sticking to an approach that was more visual and architectural than his contemporaries. Rather than composing outwards from a rhythmic or melodic cell, Xenakis did as the architect in simultaneously conceiving ‘the details and the ensemble.’ Otherwise, said Xenakis, ‘it all falls apart.’</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">And this puts us right back to the ‘circularity’ of my memory of <i>Metastaseis</i>. An ascent of strings is answered later on by a corresponding descent, yet runs simultaneously in my mind. One movement does not follow the other in musical time, but somehow lies opposite, as the outer walls of a building. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Circularity is also present in the fade out of the strings at the close. Fades signify the infinite: I imagine them returning inaudibly to the beginning of the piece, beginning somewhere else and running forever, closing the circle and keeping the structure intact. </p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">	
    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>Metastaseis'</i> companion piece is perched on a hillside near the town of Éveux in France. It's a grey concrete hermitage - I’ve never been, but the pictures are enough to convince me that any pilgrimage would be well worth my time. It stands as a brutalist intruder among the surrounding hills: a resolute asymmetrical figure governed by straight lines and right angles, suspended on concrete stilts over the natural incline below. It is the Dominican Priory of Sainte Marie de la Tourette, the first building for which Xenakis was principal architect. Its stark geometry is definitely Xenakis’s, and definitely not Le Corbusier’s – you need only look at the smooth lines of Le Corbusier’s contemporaneous Notre Dame du Haut to see for certain the hand of Xenakis at La Tourette.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">‘Nothing sanctimonious’ was the directive the order gave to the architect, which suited the atheist fine. That’s not to say there isn’t a particular spirituality around the building. It’s best understood, I think, as the expression of Xenakis’s wonderment at the universe, standing closer to animism than the One-True-God credo of the monks it was built to house. La Tourette refuses the distinction between the spiritual and the physical. ‘Cannons of light’ form almost-plastified light funnels to illuminate the inner chambers, while the loggias work as <i>brise-soleils</i> to the monks’ cells on the interior.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container"> 
    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>Metastaseis</i> and La Tourette are more like composites than unbroken totalities. The former is divided into four movements, just as separate parts of La Tourette – like the alcove for the organ which disrupts the building’s exterior – make up a mass greater than the sum of its parts. An architectural sense of proportion and juxtaposition in <i>Metastaseis</i> finds its counterpart in the right angles and heterogeneity of La Tourette.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">While the duration of notes in the second movement reference the Fibonacci sequence, and in turn the visual harmonics of the Golden Section, Xenakis’s glissandi are the central element of <i>Metastaseis</i>. Mahler and Bartòk made use of them certainly, but never to such a structural end. To the first-time listener, they must seem the most ‘architectural’ feature. They are the concrete wave, the sheets of movement in Xenakis’s score. Theoretically, they are the sound of unbroken ascent or descent of a group of strings; really, they are geological, the transformation of sound beyond vibration and into something concrete.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">(Another function of the glissandi, of course, is to analogise Einstein’s idea of time as a function of matter and energy, and express relativistic time through the applications of intensity, register and density of scoring. But that’s another day’s work.)</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">In terms of relating architecture to music, the premise is simple: the glissando, like the sound event, exists as a series of relations. A string line cannot be understood in isolation. Like Xenakis’s memory of the protests of war-time Athens, the glissando is a sonic whole. The opening of <i>Metastaseis</i> is ominous – strings play in unison, threatening at a sudden dispersion. Then, each individual part pulls away, gathering pace and embarking outwards in slow glissandi, accelerating to its endpoint and hovering there in a massive cluster. It is the sound of a coastal shelf, a barnacled creature from the deep rearing its head.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The glissandi also cast light on the title of the piece: <i>meta-</i> means after or beyond, and <i>–staseis</i> relates to ‘immobility’. It refers to the contrast between movement and standstill, change and sameness. With music, Xenakis could analogise not only a geometry or architectural structure, but also the trajectory of lines moving through space, the changing dimensions of mass form.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">And while this sounds dense, Xenakis’s work was always meant for an audience. His art was never simply a construction of mass form in space, but an entity to be communicated. In merging music and architecture, Xenakis always maintained an awareness of the way this synthesis would be perceived. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">This is where Xenakis’s crucial appreciation of density comes in, particularly at La Tourette and also in <i>Metastaseis</i>. Simply defined, density in architecture is the number of objects per unit of space, in music the number of events per unit time. When there’s a lot of activity in musical passage, we call it ‘dense’: a macroscopic understanding of sound. It also explains why we experience the glissandi of <i>Metastaseis</i> as a sonic shape – Xenakis believed that people only have the capacity to grasp global outlines of sonorities. In a fugue, it’s impossible to follow more than three parts at the same time; if you try listening to all the sections of a jazz band at once, you’re bound to get lost pretty quickly. Xenakis’s consideration of ‘shape’ in music is where he meets Le Corbusier’s definition of mass in <i>Vers une Architecture</i>: ‘by which our senses perceive and measure and are most fully affected.’</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">This definition is where Le Corbusier shows himself up as a painter posing as an architect. The words ‘most fully affected’ tell the full story: the structure’s functional role is unimportant - Le Corbusier unequivocally links shape to a poetic sense of beauty, ugliness, or interest at the very least. It’s speaks of looking out across Dublin Bay from the South Wall pier; my sensation of its beauty lying in the fact the ‘coast’ is an umbrella term. My senses are ‘most fully affected’ by the running of the land from Dollymount, into Sutton and up the low hump of Howth Head; not ‘affected’ – and therefore not part of the ‘mass’ – is my awareness of a line of pylons, or the glaring red roof of a petrol station at the Bayside end of the Howth Road. The shape of the bay, for me, is how Le Corbusier would have it – determined by a lack of awareness of many of the features making up its full physical existence.</p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container"> 
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Mass is linked to density - an unconscious aggregation, and certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when you look at the panels of glass on the three exterior façades of La Tourette. They’re the monastery’s most characteristic feature, called ‘undulating’ or ‘musical’ glass panes because of the visual rhythm created by the distribution of concrete casings along the panels.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis had learned of masons in India piling odd lots of unused glass between two concrete pillars, and he wanted to replicate this at La Tourette. He was faced with a mathematical question: how should one distribute upright concrete casings to divide one sheet of glass from the other? His challenge, in other words, was the distribution of points on a line. He decided to use the Modulor to form a progression of rectangles with the same height but varying in width. These had varying densities – the intervals fluctuated in distance, some close together and others expanding out, so that the panel looked like the bellows of an accordion. He superposed two more panels above the first floor, which made three lines; like staves, they provided a vertical counterpoint in a visual polyrhythm.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It’s true that the ‘undulating’ windows are named for their resemblance to waves, but it also teases at a hidden connection. Our naming of the windows articulate not only what we see, but how we see it. We are self-consciously noting our perception of density at work, viewing the concrete casings not as individual events, but as an ‘outline’, or a macroscopic aggregation of objects in space.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>Adagio</i>, <i>presto</i>, and <i>largo</i> really signify density, or the number of events per unit of time. Added to these the use of tremolo, <i>pizzicato</i> and <i>col legno</i> in <i>Metastaseis</i> (particularly in the second movement), and the music takes on parameters of three-dimensions, expanding and contracting in musical time.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">I walk to the end of the South Wall pier and look down the coast. It’s my ignorance to many of its particulars that determines its overall impression, and brings forth its ‘mass’.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">We see waves in the windows at La Tourette for the same reason we hear composite forms in <i>Metastaseis's</i> glissandi. A knowledge of music and architecture gave rise to an appreciation of density, and this, in turn, to a new music of shape and volume.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">At the première of <i>Metastaseis</i> at Donaueschingen in 1955, the festival organizer bravely offered his opinion after the audience had responded with a less than warm reaction. He described it as ‘atomic music’ – another way of admitting that he was totally lost for words. His reaction was no different to most of the public: as stunning as a mushroom cloud, <i>Metastaseis</i> had left an audience winded and staring up at this towering musical edifice. Looks of confusion ran across their unwitting faces.</p>
