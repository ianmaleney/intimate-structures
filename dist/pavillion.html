    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>Two structures</i>: The Atomium still stands as the symbol of the 1958 World’s Fair, built by the Ossegempark in Brussels. It is made up of nine metal spheres which represent each an atom in a cell of iron crystal. It carries the spirit of the first post-war World’s Fair, a time when the world looked to science as the barrier between war and peace. The subtitle for an Editions Racine book on Expo ‘58 was the phrase ‘Between utopia and reality’.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">At a plot beside the Ossegempark there is neither an absence nor a presence - not many know this is the site where the Philips Pavilion once stood. It appeared in Brussels the way a sinkhole might: people marveled, scratched their chins and pointed at this wild intrusion in the city. But before too long, normal life resumed and it was gone. The Philips Pavilion was demolished soon after the ending of the Fair. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">For visitors to Expo ’58, both the Pavilion and the Atomium were strange visions of a future in which a scientific utopia was suddenly within reach.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">The post-war boom made Philips, the Dutch technology firm, a rich company indeed: they developed and sold fluorescent lighting, loudspeakers, X-ray machines, telephones and audio systems. Louis Kalff, the company’s artistic director, headed up their pavilion at Expo ’58, and decided that rather than featuring commercial goods, they would showcase their technological innovation by hiring an artist, an architect and a composer to create a multimedia spectacle. Not only would this exhibit their latest electronic machines, but Philips would appear also as a progressive patron of the arts.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Le Corbusier accepted Louis Kalff’s offer to work on the pavilion in 1956 and began putting together the visuals for what would be known as the ‘Poème électronique’; Xenakis was to design the building and would compose a 2-minute piece to be played prior to and after each show; the main composition would be written by Edgard Varèse.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It strikes me that Philips put the three artists in a very odd position: they had a lot of money and very few restrictions.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The floor-plan of the structure was shaped like a cow’s stomach – a curved passageway (where the sounds of burning charcoal in Xenakis’s <i>Concret PH</i> were played) held the public until they entered the main auditorium for Le Corbusier’s visuals and Varèse’s composition. Afterwards, they were digested into another passageway where <i>Concret PH</i> was played once again, and they filtered out into the light of day.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">To the spectators, the building looked like a three-pronged tent, a deformed UFO, maybe a melting iron sheet: more likely nothing at all. Built in reinforced concrete, Xenakis had let loose to design wild, curved shapes without supporting beams or girders.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">In the end, thin-shelled concrete panels formed the nine hyperbolic paraboloids that defined the structure of the Philips Pavilion, while a skeleton of steel cables were strung from across the surfaces from steel posts.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The inspiration for the building’s shape was both abstract and musical. Xenakis wanted the building to capture the sense of continuous motion – to appear as a totality, and not a series of components. For this he looked to natural shapes, studying egg shells as well as the shells of marine and terrestrial animals to find a structure that exhibited unbroken lines of continuity.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">He also considered the glissandi of <i>Metastaseis's</i> graphic score – if he could make music out of continuous motion, could he do the same with architecture? Indeed the shell of the Philips Pavilion bears an unmistakable resemblance to the ruled surfaces of <i>Metastaseis’s</i> glissandi, continuous change made still in concrete.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">A new shape needed a new approach. Instead of sketching, Xenakis imitated the glissandi with a tool made of two wooden rods joined by elastic strings, twisting them this way and that to tease out unusual three-dimensional forms. He came up with the hyperbolic paraboloid, created when a line parallel to a given plane is passed through two straight lines in space – it’s a parabola, like a horse-shoe in three dimensions.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The name Xenakis gave to the process of starting with a three-dimensional curved shape rather than a two-dimensional sketch was ‘volumetric architecture’. In the classical Western style, architects begin with a sketch of a flat surface and translate it into three dimensions using the plumb line. Xenakis was determined to avoid this translation, and to design in three dimensions from the beginning. With the development of materials such as reinforced concrete, and without the necessity of a building frame, cylinders, cones, curves, shells and other three-dimensional forms were limited only by the architect’s imagination. In Xenakis’s case, this meant <i>Metastaseis</i> could be made solid.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis looked to nature because classical architecture failed to offer the shapes he needed. When I lived in Rome, I could see the domes of basilicas and public buildings from the window of my flat - perhaps the Teatro dell’Opera was among them. Domes make for a nice view, but they’re essentially a deception - classical architecture’s attempt at unbroken continuity. Looking closely, the illusion of perfect roundness is broken by the ugly fact of their support structures beneath - drums, pendentives, and vaults. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">No wonder Xenakis found the shapes he needed in shells and eggs. When I think of the shapes of unbroken continuity, I picture the tear-drops of hanging Provolone cheese - not the dome of St. Peter’s, nor even the Pantheon.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">A separate, but no less important, aspect of the Philips Pavilion was the collaboration between Xenakis and Edgard Varèse. It’s a partnership that puts Xenakis’s works into some perspective. Both men were similarly destructive of tradition: Varèse, like Xenakis, had suffered at the hands of an audience when the 1954 debut of his composition 'Déserts' was met with vitriol in Paris.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">With serialism the dominant idiom in ‘new’ music of the day, even a concert-going public familiar with contemporary composition would have seen Varèse and Xenakis’s music as alien, or crass, or worse.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">For their part, the composers saw themselves as opponents of Schoenberg and Webern’s dodecaphony. In ‘The Crisis of Serial Music’, Xenakis’s first article in Hermann Scherchen’s <i>Gravesano Blätter</i> journal, he criticized serialism’s limiting of itself to the logical permutations arising from a bank of 12 or 13 semitones. Xenakis saw a contradiction between the linear polyphonic system – the written sequence of notes – and the audible result, and his appreciation of density and sonic outline was in part a reaction to serialism’s shapelessness. Xenakis complained that: ‘the macroscopic effect (of serialism) is one of unreasonable dispersion of sounds.’ When performed, serialism was a criss-crossing of lines: the complexity of patterns prevented the listener from giving the music shape as it played out in time. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Neither could Xenakis and Varèse understand serialism’s over-reliance on pitch, especially in an age when technology allowed the composer to express sound to the smallest fractions of a whole tone. As far back as <i>Amériques</i>, a composition first performed in 1926, Varèse had used the siren as part of the orchestra, gaining with it a full gradient of sounds rather than the discrete intervals of Western scales. Like Xenakis, he considered music in spatial terms: not only were siren sounds ‘parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories,’ his equal treatment of musical parameters – timbre, dynamics, density – gave his compositions shape. And while physical analogies like ‘surfaces’ and ‘mass’ crop up with Xenakis, so Varèse referred to sections of his music as ‘zones’ – a region of space with two axes, vertical and horizontal, and density in vertical and horizontal directions too.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">I smile to myself wondering whether these ideas bored the people that shook their umbrellas and folded their coats as they entered the Philips Pavilion when it opened in April 1958, five hundred at a time. Since when was the siren a journey through the full tonic spectrum, and not the sound of an ambulance approaching?</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Whatever they thought at the time, they witnessed a new kind of poem – a synthesis of electronics – as they wandered through the passageway and cast themselves into the darkness. Four hundred speakers played Varèse’s eight-minute collage of percussion, electronic tone generators, machines and the human voice, as Le Corbusier’s images of monkeys and shellfish, religious scenes from Giotto, nuclear explosions and the Eiffel Tower were split and distorted, finding mutant form on the curves of the interior walls.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The audience filed out blinking in the light of day. It was 1958: Yuri Gagarin’s space flight was three years away; in four years time the Cuban Missile Crisis would bring the world to the brink of destruction. Here in Brussels, Xenakis’s alien structure must have seemed not a little frightening. It was, at its bones, a performance of the future.</p>
