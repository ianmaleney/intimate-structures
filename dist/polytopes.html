    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>A gesture</i>: Beside the recently-opened Pompidou Centre, a metal frame forms three curved shells; it is covered in a deep red vinyl. Inside, the ceiling is lit by 1600 flash-bulbs. Four lasers search the room and are reflected by four hundred adjustable mirrors. The Diatope, the last of Xenakis’s Polytopes, houses a spectacle created for the 1978 opening of the Pompidou Centre next door. 140,000,000 digital commands generate a performance as lasers, mirrors and flashes alternate every 1/25th of a second. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The flashing of light is so rapid it appears as a continuous glare, and music emanates in slow waves, disorienting the audience’s sense of time. Lighting projects the shapes of lotuses and wheels – but any familiarity is fleeting. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It is an attack of music, light and architecture. It is beyond articulation, yet surely not beyond meaning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The Philips Pavilion marked the end of Xenakis’s time with Le Corbusier, and the beginning of a new direction with the synthesis of media – architecture, light and sound – as the key-stone in a pursuit of the mimesis of nature.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">I think Xenakis describes his new form best in <i>Musique de l'architecture</i> as ‘plastic ideas of life beginning…’ His intentions were certainly no less grand. And always I feel he intended the same effect for the audience: the lingering between uncertainty and instant knowledge, a battle between rationality and intuition.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It takes us back to the problem of articulation. I experience Xenakis’s music as if I were cast into some great natural catastrophe: the forces are far greater than my capacity to understand them, and so I flounder, gasp, and eventually submit. And then it can be totally beautiful.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Taking the ‘Poème éléctronique’ as inspiration. Xenakis named his multimedia events ‘Polytopes’ – ‘poly’ meaning many, and ‘topos’ deriving from the Greek for ‘places’. A dark inner chamber, just like the Philips Pavilion, would provide a suitable platform for Xenakis to experiment with the merging of different forms – a space with no privileged vantage points, no centre, and curved inner walls.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The Polytopes were constructed in locations across the world, as sound and light interacted variously with built space and landscape. The first, at Montréal in 1967, was held in an art gallery. Polytopes at Persepolis (1971) and Mycenes (1978) were played in the ruins of ancient civilisations, while spectacles in Paris – the Polytope de Cluny and the Diatope – took place in an ancient Roman baths and beside the Pompidou Centre respectively.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Two developments set the Polytopes apart from Xenakis’s previous work: firstly, music was electroacoustic rather than orchestral; second, Xenakis introduced light as a medium.</p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Again, Xenakis’s understanding of sound and light was geometrical. Working electroacoustically meant he could distribute speakers throughout the room, moving closer to a physical realization of musical space, rather than its abstraction in music. I see the speaker as a building block: an absolute point which, when played simultaneously with other speakers, created an ‘acoustic straight line’. With the audience in the centre, and a space ‘paved’ entirely with speakers, the sound created an individual audiopath for each audience member as it accelerated quickly or slowly, sounding erratically or incessantly. Electroacoustics forced an audience to consider the movement of an object in space – rather than a surface, the distribution of loudspeakers introduced a mass of sound in flux.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Light was a new medium for Xenakis’s synthesis of forms. As an architect, light had been an important element of building: the ‘cannons of light’ at La Tourette were as important (and as physical) a feature as the priory’s bell-tower. In the Polytopes, light was expressed as laser beams and flashes, which, considered geometrically, becomes a system of lines and points in time. The application of light in the Polytopes differed to Xenakis’s architectural work because he could control its source and manipulate its direction, shape and frequency. Le Corbusier’s approach to light had always been painterly – it was modified by the texture of surfaces – but for Xenakis’s Polytopes, light was architectural. It existed not in a pictorial space but in a real space, as a bodiless form with spatial properties.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The abstraction of sound and light into Cartesian points and lines meant that Xenakis had a system of controlling the representation of matter moving through space. With sound shapes forming through the co-ordination of disparate speakers, light was plotted variously through torch-bearing children and goats drawing luminous traces across a mountainside, as at Mycenes, or the laser beams and xenon flashes at Cluny. The merging of light with sound created a spectacle of forces at play – a galaxy in miniature.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis’s use of light, sound and built space says much about his artistic beliefs. There are plenty of quotations about the power of music over language (‘Music expresses that which cannot be put into words’ says Victor Hugo), but what about light and architecture? For Xenakis, music was not limited to sound – ‘musical’ forms were art without the anthropomorphism or realistic references. Light and architecture were ‘musical’ because they were not perceived through language; like music, they were arts ‘outside of man’ – closer to the logic of thought than figurative painting or sculpture. And while these abstract forms were a representation of matter beyond man, it was to humankind that Xenakis was speaking. The Polytopes recalled the opening lines of <i>Musiques Formelles</i> – through art, as in nature, a universal truth could be revealed which was beyond the artwork itself.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">It reminds us of Keats and Wordsworth, and their very human belief – quaint by today’s standards - in the sublime. It’s no paradox to say there was a touch of the Romantic about Xenakis’s calculations.</p>

    <p class="c-chapter-text">When I was fourteen and on a family holiday in Wexford, I left our rented holiday home and set out for a walk across the fields. It was summer and I had nothing to do but keep going, so I kept walking until I reached a tree by a river. There was nothing in sight but fields and hedges – no houses, no roads. Whatever it was I took off all my clothes, climbed up the tree and jumped from fifteen feet up. I dressed quickly and hoped no-one had seen – the hand that broke my fall could barely hold a fork a week later.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Keats, Wordsworth, and Xenakis too have this territory well marked. Was it the arrangement of rivers, fields and light in my mind’s eye that sent me climbing naked up a tree?</p>

  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">A new line in Xenakis’s musical thinking influenced the Polytopes, bringing them closer to the perfect mimesis of nature he sought to realise. While <i>Metastaseis</i> expressed the combination of miniscule causalities in making a sonic whole, <i>Pithoprakta</i> (1955 – 56) introduced a ‘stochastic’ method to describe the distribution and relations of scattered particles in space. The idea came to Xenakis from memories of camping trips to Attica; as he lay listening to the beat of thousands of raindrops on the roof of his tent, he wondered how he could re-create its rhythm in music. His answer was by using mathematical theories of probability, and through the application of a system to describe the randomness of natural events, Xenakis could articulate the meaning of <i>Pithoprakta’s</i> title: ‘actions through probability’. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text"><i>Pithoprakta</i> sets Xenakis at the window, staring out wide-eyed. The piece analogises the movement of gas molecules according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann theory, a phenomenon in which particles tend to a mean distribution as they disperse in a space of constant temperature and pressure. Not many love-songs feature the representation of random variables - the speed at which particles ricochet off one another as they collide - but this is one. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Xenakis’s devotion is marked not by overt emotion in the music, but by a painstaking translation of nature through logical systems of representation. Using probability theory, he calculated the particles’ range of speeds and mapped their distribution by notation, again employing the glissando to articulate the speed of particles in musical space. The result is choreographed chaos; for me, it’s pastoralism through the microscope. Listen to the <i>pizzicati</i> just shy of six minutes in and know that Xenakis writes for the heart too.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="c-chapter-text--container">
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Stochasticism was Xenakis’s way of ordering the vast wilderness of unruly sounds that entered his mind at every turn. His study of random variables, extending to lighting, used probability calculations to code lighting sequences and produce projective geometry or choreographed flashes and beams. If the distribution of mass events in nature were based on stochastics, so Xenakis’s mimetic art would be too.</p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">The mathematical conception of Xenakis’s Polytopes may be novel, but their effect on the audience is less so. When words failed me, I leapt from a tree. I guess the best way to put it is that I was taken over by a feeling of inarticulacy – a fairly common experience of natural beauty; granted, my reaction was extreme, but by being non-verbal and instinctive, it is part of the ‘sublime’ which Xenakis obscurely sets to capture. </p>
    <p class="c-chapter-text">Despite his music’s abstraction, Xenakis at his desk shared the same motivation as Turner at his canvas. His was music through a well-polished mirror, repeating: ‘…on a lower level what Nature carries out on a grand scale.’</p>
